The FEATURES selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. 

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of measurements that were estimated from these FEATURES that are included in the dataset: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

In other words, each VARIABLE is the measurement of the mean and standard deviation of each of the features listed above. 

The ACTIVITIES correspond to these codes:
1	walking
2 	walking upstairs
3 	walking downstairs
4 	sitting
5 	standing
6 	laying

In the FINAL dataset, the average of the VARIABLES was calculated according to the ACTIVITY of each subject using the AGGREGATE function.
